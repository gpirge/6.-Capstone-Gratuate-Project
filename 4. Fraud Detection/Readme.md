Used a highly imbalanced dataset containing transactions made by credit cardholders with the objective to build a model that predicts whether a transaction is fraud. 

The data gives no domain info (there are no column names). 

Logistic regression, random forest and deep learning were used, and the model was deployed by Flask.
